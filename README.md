## GitLab Authentication Sample

This repository provides a sample application that demonstrates how to authenticate users using GitLab. It allows users to log in using their GitLab accounts and access protected resources based on their GitLab roles and permissions.
## Getting Started

To get started with the GitLab authentication sample, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository

    git clone <repository-url>

Install dependencies:

    cd <repository-folder>
    npm install

Configure the application:

  <i>Rename the .env.example file to .env.
    Open the .env file and provide the necessary configuration values:
        GITLAB_CLIENT_ID: Your GitLab application's client ID.
        GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET: Your GitLab application's client secret.
        GITLAB_REDIRECT_URI: The redirect URI for your application.
        PORT: The port on which the application should run.</i>

Start the application:


    npm start

    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:<port> to access the application.

## Usage

    Click on the "Login with GitLab" button to initiate the GitLab authentication process.
    You will be redirected to the GitLab login page where you can enter your GitLab credentials.
    After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the application and logged in.
    Once logged in, you can access protected resources or perform actions based on your GitLab roles and permissions.
